# BMI-Calculator-Android-Application
• Developed an Android application using Java and Android Studio for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI).
<br>
• The application will help you to know the condition of your body by taking into consideration the parameters like weight
  and height.
<br>
• The applications asks user to enter their height and weight and after analyzing the input it displays information such as
  Underweight or Normal weight or Overweight.
<br>
• For analyzing the users details it follows Body Mass Index(BMI.)
<br>
• I used Android studio for developing the application, Java for event handling and XML(Extensible Markup
  Language) for Layout.
